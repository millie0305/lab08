            <p>In New Leaf, Isabelle tries her hardest to look up to the mayor as their secretary. 
            Whenever the mayor completes a public works project, she will ask the mayor if they want to attend a celebration for the project's completion, 
            and will frown if the mayor vows out with the celebration. She also values the health and safety of the player, especially in instances where the player hasn't played their town in months. 
            During holidays and events, Isabelle will tell the mayor to take a break from their duties in order to enjoy the festivities. 
            She will also close town hall if she ends up going to the plaza to celebrate.
            </p>
            <p>In New Horizons, Isabelle retains her hardworking nature from New Leaf, but she has also been shown to be extroverted, especially in the instance of her morning announcements. 
            Routinely, she occasionally talks about television, or various aspects regarding her life, such as Digby and her missing sock, only to blush after realizing that what she said does not qualify as news. 
            As of 2.0, this doesn't happen as often, as she usually has different announcements to give.
