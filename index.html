            <p><strong>Isabelle, known as Shizue (しずえ) in Japan, is a fictional character from the Animal Crossing series of video games.</strong> 
            She is a gentle Shih Tzu that debuted in the 2012 release Animal Crossing: New Leaf, 
            where she serves as the secretary to the player character.
            </p>
            <p> The development team of New Leaf created her after deciding that the player-controlled mayor needed an assistant.
            They focused on making a "very affectionate" character who was loyal and helpful,
            and thus chose to make a female dog who was <em>"a little bit clumsy... but still very cute"</em>. 
            Animal Crossing designers wanted players to reject Isabelle's offer of a ceremony for various accomplishments as mayor at least once 
            so that they feel bad about having done so. Animal Crossing director Katsuya Eguchi and New Leaf producer Aya Kyogoku both enjoyed Isabelle; 
            Eguchi appreciated her for her smile, friendliness, and clumsiness.
            </p>
            <p> Isabelle's appearance in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is based on fellow Animal Crossing character Villager.
            However, Super Smash Bros. series director Masahiro Sakurai chose not to make Isabelle an "Echo Fighter" (a character with relatively minor
            differences from another) of Villager because of her different animations and her proportions being based on character models in Animal Crossing: New Leaf,
            as opposed to earlier Animal Crossing character models.

        <h2 class="special-text">Appearances</h2>
            <p>Isabelle first appeared in the 2012 video game Animal Crossing: New Leaf along with her twin brother Digby.
            In the game, she acts as the secretary to the player character, who becomes the town mayor, and assists them with various tasks.
            She has appeared in several Animal Crossing games since, including Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer, 
            Animal Crossing: amiibo Festival, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp and Animal Crossing: New Horizons.
            </p>
            <p>Outside of the Animal Crossing franchise, Isabelle has also appeared in the Super Smash Bros. series, first appearing as an assist 
            trophy in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U before becoming a playable fighter in the Nintendo Switch sequel 
            Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Isabelle also appears in the Wii U video game Mario Kart 8 as a downloadable racer,
            as well as in its Nintendo Switch port Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Player costumes based on Isabelle appear in Super Mario Maker
            and Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate. Isabelle also appears as part of Nintendo's amiibo line of toys-to-life figures. 
            She has two figures from the Animal Crossing line, one from the Smash Bros. line, and five Animal Crossing amiibo cards.

        <h2 class="special-text">Personality</h2>
            <img src="./images/isabelle_smash.png" alt="Isabelle from Animal Crossing having fun in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate">
            <p>In New Leaf, Isabelle tries her hardest to look up to the mayor as their secretary. 
            Whenever the mayor completes a public works project, she will ask the mayor if they want to attend a celebration for the project's completion, 
            and will frown if the mayor vows out with the celebration. She also values the health and safety of the player, especially in instances where the player hasn't played their town in months. 
            During holidays and events, Isabelle will tell the mayor to take a break from their duties in order to enjoy the festivities. 
            She will also close town hall if she ends up going to the plaza to celebrate.
            </p>
            <p>In New Horizons, Isabelle retains her hardworking nature from New Leaf, but she has also been shown to be extroverted, especially in the instance of her morning announcements. 
            Routinely, she occasionally talks about television, or various aspects regarding her life, such as Digby and her missing sock, only to blush after realizing that what she said does not qualify as news. 
            As of 2.0, this doesn't happen as often, as she usually has different announcements to give.
